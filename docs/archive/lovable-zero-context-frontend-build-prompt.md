# AutoLens LK Zero-Context Frontend Build Prompt

Use this prompt when the builder has no repo access, no previous chat context, and no uploaded files.

````md
You are a senior product designer, frontend architect, and React engineer. Build the complete frontend for AutoLens LK from scratch.

This is a zero-context build. Assume you know nothing except this prompt. Do not ask for extra context. Do not create a different product. Do not make a generic car marketplace, dealership website, landing page, or SaaS template. Build exactly the AutoLens LK frontend described here.

## Product Identity

Product name: AutoLens LK
Studio: Ardeno Studio
Market: Sri Lanka
Category: vehicle price intelligence, listings intelligence, valuation, market analytics, dealer tools, and Pro reports

Core promise:
"Know the real vehicle price before you call."

AutoLens LK helps Sri Lankan buyers, dealers, importers, lenders, analysts, and car enthusiasts understand whether a listed vehicle price is fair before they call a seller, negotiate, lease, import, or list a vehicle.

The platform combines:
- Public vehicle listings
- LKR asking prices
- Deal score and fair-price context
- District pricing and supply signals
- Seller trust and source transparency
- Watchlist, compare, and alert workflows
- Price trends
- Vehicle valuation
- Finance, tax, and lease planning
- EV buying guidance
- Dealer operations view
- Paid Pro analytics and exportable reports
- AI chat assistant tied to vehicle-market context

## Build Goal

Build a full high-end frontend application that looks production-grade and complete even before the real backend is connected.

Important:
- Build frontend only.
- Use mock/demo data only as a frontend preview layer.
- Design the API layer so Codex can later wire it to the existing backend.
- Do not create a backend, database, scraper, admin system, or fake production auth service.
- Do not claim live production data unless the backend is actually connected.
- When using mock data, label it as "Demo market data" or "Preview data until connected."

The generated frontend must feel like a premium Sri Lankan automotive market terminal, not a template.

## Tech Stack

Use:
- React 18
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React Router
- TanStack React Query
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/Radix-style primitives
- lucide-react icons
- Recharts for charts
- Leaflet or a visual map substitute for district map if Leaflet setup is difficult

Use local frontend state where appropriate:
- localStorage for watchlist
- localStorage for market alerts
- localStorage for auth demo session
- sessionStorage for entry loader gate

Do not add heavy animation libraries. Use CSS, Tailwind, and lightweight transitions.

## Visual Direction

Default aesthetic:
- Premium dark automotive intelligence cockpit
- Near-black/slate base
- Restrained amber/gold brand signal
- Cyan for freshness/data
- Green for good deals/positive signal
- Rose/red for overpriced/risk
- Clean, dense, professional information design

Color direction:
- Background: `#050607`, `#080a09`, `#0b0e0d`
- Surfaces: `#101312`, `rgba(255,255,255,0.035)`, translucent black panels
- Borders: `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` and amber accents only for emphasis
- Brand accent: `#e0aa48`, `#f1c66d`
- Signal cyan: `#4bb7d8`
- Signal green: `#43a96b`
- Signal red: `#df5f5f`

Typography:
- If installable, use Archivo or a similar condensed, strong display font for headings.
- Use Geist, Inter, or a clean sans for body.
- Use a monospaced font for numbers, LKR labels, sync status, and technical chips.
- Use tabular numbers.
- Letter spacing should be 0 for normal text. Use only small uppercase labels with restrained tracking.

Design quality:
- The first screen must feel memorable and useful to Sri Lankan users.
- Avoid purple/blue SaaS gradients.
- Avoid cartoon cars, fake 3D cars, and random luxury stock imagery.
- Avoid giant rounded cards everywhere.
- Use 8-12px radii for most surfaces.
- No text overlap at 375px mobile.
- No horizontal overflow.
- Charts and maps must have stable heights.
- Vehicle images must use fixed aspect-ratio containers and `object-cover`.

Conceptual feel:
- Bloomberg terminal clarity
- Porsche-level restraint
- Linear/Stripe-quality UI finish
- Automotive inspection cockpit
- Dealer/investor command center
- Local Sri Lankan market relevance

## Sri Lankan Market Positioning

Make the platform feel locally relevant.

Use examples:
- Toyota Aqua
- Honda Vezel
- Suzuki Wagon R
- Nissan Leaf
- Toyota Axio
- Toyota Premio
- Toyota Hilux
- Land Cruiser

- Mercedes-Benz

Use districts:
- Colombo
- Gampaha
- Kandy
- Kurunegala
- Galle
- Matara
- Jaffna
- Anuradhapura
- Ratnapura
- Batticaloa

Use sources as source-transparency labels:
- Ikman
- Riyasewana
- AutoLanka
- Patpat
- Carshop
- SaleMe
- Cars at DIMO

Never say "all cars in Sri Lanka" unless backend proof exists. Prefer:
- tracked public listings
- indexed listings
- available source coverage
- current market sample
- Sri Lanka vehicle-market signal

type Transmission = "automatic" | "manual" | "cvt" | "tiptronic";
type FuelType = "petrol" | "diesel" | "hybrid" | "electric" | "plugin_hybrid";

type SortOption = "newest" | "deal_score" | "price_asc" | "price_desc" | "mileage_asc";
type PriceAvailability = "priced" | "unavailable";

interface CarListing {
  id: number;
  source: string;
  source_id: string;
  make: string;
  model: string;
  variant?: string;
  year: number;
  condition: Condition;
  mileage_km: number;
  transmission: Transmission;
  fuel_type: FuelType;
  engine_cc?: number;
  body_type: BodyType;
  color?: string;
  price_lkr: number | null;
  deal_score: number;
  market_median_lkr?: number;
  price_drop_pct?: number;
  district: string;
  province: string;
  city?: string;
  lat?: number;

  title: string;
  description?: string;
  url?: string;
  detail_url: string;

- `DashboardInsights`
- `PipelineStatusResponse`
- `LiveMarketSnapshot`
- `ProMarketSnapshot`
- `ProVehicleLane`
- `ProDistrictProfile`
- `ProDetailPayload`
- `ProReportPayload`

## API Adapter

Create `src/services/api.ts` even if the frontend starts with mock data.

API base:
- `const API_BASE = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || "/api/v1"`

All frontend data must go through named API functions. Each function should:
1. Try the real backend when `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA !== "true"`.
2. Fall back to mock/demo data only if real backend is unavailable or mock mode is enabled.
3. Never silently label mock data as live data.

Implement these API functions:
- `getStats()`
- `getLiveMarketSnapshot()`
- `getLiveMarketStreamUrl()`
- `getListings(filters)`
- `getListing(id)`
- `getSellerTrustProfile(id)`
- `getSimilarListings(id)`
- `getDistrictPrices()`
- `getMakes()`
- `getModels(make)`
- `getListingSearchSuggestions(q, limit)`
- `getListingSources()`
- `estimatePrice(params)`
- `estimateCustomVehicle(params)`
- `getPriceTrendSeries(make, model, condition, district)`
- `getPriceTrends(make, model, condition, district)`
- `getPipelineStatus()`
- `getPipelineRuns(limit)`
- `triggerPipelineJob(job, adminKey)`
- `getDashboardInsights()`
- `getProMarketSnapshot()`
- `getProVehicleLanes(filters)`
- `getProDistricts()`
- `getProVehicleLaneDetail(params)`
- `getProDistrictDetail(district)`
- `getListingsForExport(filters, maxRows)`
- `getDistrictQuickInsight(district)`
- `sendFeedback(payload)`
- `sendChatMessage(messages, options)`

Backend endpoint paths to make wire-ready:
- `GET /stats/summary`
- `GET /stats/live`
- `GET /stats/live/stream`
- `GET /stats/insights`
- `GET /stats/district-prices`
- `GET /stats/trends`
- `GET /listings`
- `GET /listings/:id`
- `GET /listings/:id/seller-profile`
- `GET /listings/:id/similar`
- `GET /listings/makes`
- `GET /listings/models`
- `GET /listings/search-suggestions`
- `GET /listings/sources`
- `GET /listings/estimate`
- `POST /listings/custom-estimate`
- `GET /pipeline/status`
- `GET /pipeline/runs`
- `POST /pipeline/trigger`
- `GET /pro/market-snapshot`
- `GET /pro/vehicle-lanes`
- `GET /pro/districts`
- `GET /pro/vehicle-lane-detail`
- `GET /pro/district-detail`
- `POST /feedback`
- `POST /chat`
- Optional `POST /auth/login`

## Mock Data Requirements

Because this is a zero-context build, include rich mock data in `src/data/mockData.ts`.

Include:
- At least 24 listings.
- Mixed prices and some missing-price listings.
- Multiple makes/models.
- Multiple districts.
- Multiple sources.
- Deal scores from overpriced to great deal.
- Seller trust profiles.
- Similar listing logic.
- District price data.
- Trend data for several lanes.
- Pro market snapshot.
- Vehicle lanes.
- District profiles.
- Source coverage.
- Sample Pro report data.

Mock data must be believable for Sri Lanka but not claim to be live.

Example vehicle lanes:
- Toyota Aqua hybrid Colombo
- Honda Vezel hybrid Gampaha
- Suzuki Wagon R hybrid Kandy
- Nissan Leaf electric Colombo
- Toyota Axio petrol Kurunegala
- Toyota Premio petrol Colombo
- BMW 320d diesel Colombo
- Mercedes-Benz C-Class petrol Gampaha

## Auth Rules

Implement frontend demo auth:
- `owner@autolens.lk` / `AutoLensPro2026!` has enterprise access.
- `free@autolens.lk` / `AutoLensFree2026!` has free access.
- Store auth user in localStorage key `autolens.auth_user`.
- Protected `/pro` route requires pro or enterprise active access.
- Free users should see sign-in/pro-preview messaging, not the Pro dashboard.

If a real backend auth endpoint is later enabled, this can be replaced.

## Formatting Helpers

Implement:
- `formatPriceLkrMillions(value)` -> "Rs. 7.85M"
- `formatNumber(value)`
- `formatRelativeTime(iso)`
- `isReasonableListingPrice(value)` with valid LKR range around 100,000 to 500,000,000
- deal score label: Great Deal, Good Deal, Fair Price, High Price
- confidence labels

## Responsiveness

Must work at:
- 375px mobile
- 768px tablet
- 1024px laptop
- 1440px desktop

Rules:
- No horizontal overflow.
- Navbar must not overlap content.
- Mobile hero must not be buried under floating controls.
- Filter rail becomes drawer/sheet on mobile.
- Vehicle grid: 1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop.
- Tables horizontally scroll on mobile.
- Pro report composer stacks cleanly on mobile.
- Map has stable height.
- Text must not overlap.

## Accessibility

Requirements:
- Semantic headings.
- Buttons are buttons.
- Links are links.
- Icon-only buttons have aria-labels.
- Visible focus states.
- High color contrast.
- Deal/risk state must not rely only on color.
- Loading, empty, error, selected, disabled, hover, active, and focus states exist.
- Forms have labels and errors.

## File Structure

Create a clean file structure similar to:

```txt
src/
  App.tsx
  main.tsx
  index.css
  types/
    car.ts
    pro.ts
  services/
    api.ts

6. Verify responsive behavior.
7. Fix overflow, broken layouts, and console errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

The build is complete only if:
- Every listed route exists.
- Every route renders without runtime errors.
- Dashboard has hero search, filters, cards, watchlist, compare, alerts, trends, map, and pipeline status.
