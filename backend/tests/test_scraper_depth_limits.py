"""Depth guards: every scraper must be able to go as deep as its source allows.

Background: three separate limits stopped sources from ever seeing most of
their catalogue, and none of them were the source's fault.

1. ``page_budget.secondary_page_budget`` hard-capped every non-primary category
   at 25 pages and then divided the requested budget by 4. With the dump
   script's 120-page budget that meant ikman, riyasewana, patpat, saleme,
   riyahub, hitad and auto-lanka never saw more than the first 25 pages of any
   non-primary category. Live probing confirmed those catalogues are much
   deeper: riyahub's "cars" category still returns fresh older listings at page
   26, and hitad advertises a 24-page cars category with more behind it.

2. Only ikman and riyasewana had a start page. Every other paginating scraper
   began at page 1 on every run, so a source whose catalogue is deeper than one
   run can reach spent every run re-reading the same head and never advanced.

3. ``GenericDetailScraper.scrape`` kept a single ``consecutive_empty_pages``
   counter across *all* categories. The moment the first category ran out of
   pages, three empty pages later the whole source stopped — so saleme's 4
   non-car categories, riyahub's 14, dimo's and carshop's were never visited.

These tests fail if any of those regressions come back.
