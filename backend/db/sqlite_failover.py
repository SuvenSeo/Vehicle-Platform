"""Fail the live API over to the public merged SQLite dump when Neon is down.

Neon Free blocks every connection once the monthly transfer quota is exhausted.
Public browsing is supposed to use Vercel snapshots, but a Git deploy omits
the gitignored listing catalog, so the SPA falls through to `/listings` and
renders a hard error. This module downloads the public merged SQLite dump
(the same file manus-to-live publishes) and rebinds SQLAlchemy onto it so the
Hugging Face API can keep serving until Neon resets.

Self-healing monitor (Sep 2026): the original implementation ran exactly once
at startup, so a Space that was already running when the quota tripped stayed
down until a manual restart — and when Neon recovered on the 1st, the Space
kept serving the stale dump until another restart. The background thread now
re-checks every ``SQLITE_FAILOVER_CHECK_SECONDS`` (default 120s):

  * Neon down, not failed over -> download the dump and rebind. A failed
    download no longer kills the only attempt; the next tick retries.
  * Neon back, failed over     -> rebind to the saved primary DSN
    automatically (no manual Space restart needed at month reset).

Download sources are tried in order: ``MERGED_SQLITE_URLS`` (comma-separated),
then ``MERGED_SQLITE_URL``, then the built-in default — the public copy
deployed next to the site's snapshot JSON. The source repository is private,
so no repo URL is baked into this file (it is synced to a public HF Space).
