/**
 * Motormila radius scale — the single source of truth for corner rounding.
 *
 * The app's visual language is a continuous, soft "squircle" family: nothing is
 * squared, and the biggest surfaces are the roundest. Keep new work on these
 * steps instead of inventing radii, so every screen reads as one product.
 *
 * | Step | Radius | Used by |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | [MotormilaRadius.xs] | 12 dp | inner chips, mini bars, avatars-in-tile |
 * | [MotormilaRadius.sm] | 16 dp | nested tiles, inputs, small list rows |
 * | [MotormilaRadius.md] | 20 dp | compact cards, snackbars |
 * | [MotormilaRadius.lg] | 28 dp | **standard card / glass surface** |
 * | [MotormilaRadius.xl] | 32 dp | sheets, dialogs, hero surfaces |
 * | [MotormilaRadius.pill] | 50 % | buttons, chips, nav dock, badges |
