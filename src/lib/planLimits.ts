/**
 * Free vs Pro product limits.
 *
 * Free is a deliberate teaser: enough to feel Motormila’s value,
 * not enough to replace Pro for serious pricing / research work.
 * Admins and Pro/Enterprise subscribers are treated as full access.
 *
 * Product rule: free users can *open every page*, but each surface
 * soft-limits depth (counts, months, tabs, scores) instead of hard-blocking routes.
